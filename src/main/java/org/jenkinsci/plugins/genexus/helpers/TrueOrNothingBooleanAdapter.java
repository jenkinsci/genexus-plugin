/**

 * @author jlr
 *
 * For TeamWorkService2.GetVersions() GXserver exports boolean elements only if
 * they are true, and it uses "True" (title case) if that's the case.
 *
 * This adapter checks string values ignoring case (so as to recognize "True")
 * and converts to null when the value is false (so as to avoid writing it).
 *
 * This makes sure the roundtrip (converting the received XML string to Document
 * and back to string) returns the same result.
